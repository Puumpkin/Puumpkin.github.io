<p>Good job. You’re at the final stretch. One last test. As you can see, there are other test subjects, 001, 010, and 023. You all need to cross the bridge in 15 minutes. The bridge can only hold 2 people at once, and one of you needs to hold the key card to cross the bridge. If you don’t have the key card near you when crossing the bridge, everyone is disqualified. We collected some data. It seems that 001 can cross in 8 minutes, 010 in 4 minutes, 023 in 2 minutes, and 051 in 1 minute. Good Luck, your freedom depends on it. The password to cross should be the first two to cross, the second two who cross, then the person who crosses the most. Please input in lowest to the highest format (i.e. 001 comes before 051 in a problem).</p>
