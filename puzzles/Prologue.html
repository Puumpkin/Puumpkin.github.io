Many parts of the city have been shut down and abandoned, so finding work or finding someone to talk to was near impossible. I&rsquo;d ride my skateboard into town looking for work or a friend, but there was no point. It&rsquo;s a bummer, so </span><span class="c1">I spend most of my time in my dim room illuminated by nothing but my computer screen. My freshly made meal of the day sits by the keyboard and the soup I spilled a week ago.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Times are tough, but games and chat rooms are what have kept me alive. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">This morning I got a message from my best friend, Ren. I had spent many sleepless nights talking with him, and games together, arguing over who the better player was. I&rsquo;ve never seen the guy in person, and yet he&rsquo;s my closest friend. Attached to the message was a link to this new game I&#39;ve never seen before. It was called </span><span class="c1 c6">Montauk, </span><span class="c1">a one-on-one </span><span class="c0">intense real time strategy game about using your wits and quick thinking to defeat your opponent. I raised an eyebrow</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This wasn&rsquo;t a game we would normally play together,&rdquo; I thought to myself, &ldquo;but I guess we could finally find out who&rsquo;s the best.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I messaged him back, &ldquo;Seems like some fun, but this game doesn&#39;t seem like your type.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I clicked the bright green button that said downloaded, skipped through the terms and conditions, and installed it. I was in, but I still had no idea what it was about. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Time to rise and grind,&rdquo; I thought to myself&hellip; That&rsquo;s the thing about the two of us. We work and work until one of us gives up. I knew that if he sent me the game, he probably knows a lot more than me, and I couldn&rsquo;t let that happen. I tried to look up guides or videos of people playing the game, but nothing came up. &ldquo;Strange.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I messaged Ren back, &quot;Are you sure this game is popular? It looks well-made, but I can&rsquo;t find anything about the game online.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">No response. The game between the two of us had already begun, and The only way I could beat him was to press play. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Suddenly, I was blinded by a video of a woman. Her sharp English voice pierced my ear drums.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Welcome to Montauk. The goal of the game is to fight until there is no trace of your enemy left. You start on opposite sides, and grow your army. You control everything from strategizing, to collecting resources, observing your enemy, and fighting. Climb the ranks and get to the top to earn your rank of Commander.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Before I knew it, I had started my first game against a real player and I had no idea what was going on, but I knew I had to win. First I started by moving the camera around the world. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c6">I can control these little people to collect resources and build things,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I thought to myself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The objective seemed to be to build up your army and fortify your starting area. With the click of my mouse, my scouts moved out, searching for the other player.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c6">They had to be somewhere, right?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The black mini map on the top left of my screen gradually filled up with dense forest and desert, then suddenly there appeared a settlement&hellip; The scout had found them, and I began to build my forces for an attack. The enemy base lacked defense, and when my troops reached it, victory was imminent. The walls were as soft as cardboard as my army tore through their town and purged the population. I had won&hellip; Then, a victory screen appeared with the bold word &ldquo;Assist!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh? Why was this called an assist? There was no team element and I just won, yet I didn&#39;t assist in anything?&rdquo; I thought to myself. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But I didn&rsquo;t question it for long and messaged Ren. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re already behind, loser!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I started another game, and then another, and before I knew it, I was addicted. I won game after game, and every time those letters flashed on screen, &ldquo;Assist!&rdquo; I felt the dopamine flow through my veins and into every cell. I was on top of the world. I was a natural. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I slowly climbed the ranks, I wanted to be Commander&ndash;</span><span class="c1">no, I </span><span class="c1 c6">needed</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to be Commander.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Ren has still not responded. I assumed he had been focusing on practicing, and I had to be better. I joined another game. It was the usual business, send out my scouts, find the enemy, destroy their base. However, as my scouts departed, I saw something on the horizon. There it stood, a whole army--</span><span class="c1">my enemy&rsquo;s army</span><span class="c0">, and I hadn&#39;t even put up my walls yet&hellip; I stood no chance. There was nothing I could do. They were just too fast. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;They had to be cheating.&rdquo; I thought to myself. &ldquo;How could they beat me?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As I watched my last building crumble to dust, my monitor suddenly went black. I tried to close the game, nothing. It was like my computer was locked up. There was no Montauk. The game was a damn worm. This happened to Ren first, then it spread to me in that message. I should have known from the start. Then my screen came back to life, and on it was an obituary with the username of the first person I &ldquo;Assisted.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;KittyLover223&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;I never knew this person, but on the obituary was everything there was to know about them. What they loved to do and the people that loved them, and how they missed them. I felt disgusted. Click. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Raccoon2&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Another obituary. Click.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Branz07&rdquo;&ldquo; Xx_Nico96_xX&rdquo; &ldquo;</span><span class="c1">Syuc3</span><span class="c0">R&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Then the next and the next. I thought it was just a joke. I didn&rsquo;t know what to think. Then finally, it had come to an end, and all that was left on the screen was a message that said, &ldquo;Thank you, Ren.&rdquo; Attached was a video with the date of the day he sent me the message to play. I couldn&rsquo;t breathe. I froze, I closed my eyes just as his scream rang through my headphones. This had to be a nightmare. That couldn&#39;t really be Ren. Then it stopped, and the only thing in the deafening silence was the word, Assist. I assisted in those people&rsquo;s deaths. It was my fault, and now, it was my turn. Laughter filled the room, My laughter fueled by all the sadness and guilt. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c2">Thump, thump, thump.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Footsteps of a whole army echoed in the corridor behind me as the laughter became louder. What was the point, the goal, the reason? Who was in charge? As my apartment door slowly opened with a squeak, I was on the floor crying with laughter. None of my questions would be answered. For a moment there was repose. I knew nothing mattered anymore. </span></p></body></html>
